# The Arithmetic Calculator by Noob Undone v1
##### This is a basic calculator that can solve addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, involutuon(exponents), and evolution(roots).
## How to use it
### Syntax
At the current moment, you can only type two terms. The format is like this: ```x (operator) y ```
Inout:
- ```1 + 2```
- ```5 + 6 ```

After pressing ENTER, the result of the problem will appear like this: ```(count) (problem) = (answer)```
Examples:
- ```1.) 1 + 2 = 3```
- ```2.) 5 + 6 = 11 ```

There are 2 special keywords. They are ```HISTORY``` and ```CLEAR```. ```HISTORY``` will show all previous inputs of the program. ```CLEAR``` will clear all previous text in the screen and prepares for another input.
### Addition
Use the ```+``` operator in between your terms.
Examples:
- ```1 + 1 ===> 1.) 1 + 1 = 2```
- ```-3 + 1 ===> 2.) -3 + 1 = -2```

### Subtraction 
Use the ```-``` operator in between your terms.
Examples:
- ```10 - 9  ===> 1.) 10 - 9 = 1```
- ```9 - 0.6 ===> 2.) 9 - 0.6 = 8.4```

### Multiplication
Use the ```*``` operator in between your terms.
Examples:
- ```400 * 9 ===> 1.) 400 * 9 = 3600```
- ```6 * 8 ===> 2.) 6 * 8 = 48```

### Division
Use the ```/``` operator in between your terms.
Examples:
- ```1 / 2 ===> 1.) 1 / 2 = 0.5```
- ```10 / 5 ===> 2.) 10 / 5 = 2```

### Involution
Also known as using exponents. Use the ```^``` operator in between your terms.
In typing:
- x² is typped as ```x ^ 2```

More Examples:
- ```9² or 9 ^ 2 ===> 1.) 9 ^ 2 = 81```
- ```9³ or 3 ^ 3 ===> 2.) 3 ^ 3 = 27```

### Evolution
Also known as finding the root. Use the ```r``` operator in between your terms.
In typing:
- √x is typped as ```x r 2```

Examples:
- ```9 r 2 ===> 1.) 9 r 2 = 3```
- ```1000 r 3 ===> 2.) 1000 r 3 = 9.99999999999999999999999999998``` This error is due to a problem in compuing which can't be easily solved.
